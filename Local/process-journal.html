                <p>Expert consensus states that autonomous cars will be in general regular usage by 2027 with specific use cases live before then (Bainbridge, 2018). Much of the public focus on this new technology has been on autonomous cars replacing the transit tasks undertaken by personally owned and driven cars, human driven taxis and airport shuttles. Our design brief requires us to create an experience through an interface for a user with an autonomous service of choice. We believe these autonomous vehicles will be used by tourism businesses to create a new class of sightseeing tour, an auto-tour. Our team has chosen to explore the potential of a hop-on hop-off guided tour system that already exists, with an autonomous twist. My fellow group members, Ellie Kim and Ben Niceforo and I collaborated to create an app for an autonomous tourist bus service, AUTOURBUS.</p>

                <p>In the first lecture of the semester, Hamish Henderson states “A good user interface design encourages an easy, natural and engaging interaction between a user and a system, and it allows users to carry out their required task”. With this in mind throughout the breakdown of the design brief, I posed the following questions in relation to the task at hand: <br>
                - What autonomous technology exists in the market?<br>
                 - What gap in the market am I trying to fill? <br>
                 - How will my design improve or innovate existing technology?<br>

                <p>A close analysis in the literature reveals interesting issues surrounding the topic of autonomous vehicles<br>
In his study of autonomous technology, Omohundro (2014) explores how these systems are likely to behave in anti-social and harmful ways unless they are very carefully designed. Moreover, in his article <i>Experiencing Autonomous Vehicles: Crossing the Boundaries between a Drive and a Ride</i>, Meschtscherjakov (2015) discusses the challenges and potentials for UX in autonomous vehicles.
In summary, secondary research has revealed the need of efficient, careful design regarding autonomous technology. The user’s unfamiliarity may cause limitations that designers must keep in mind.</p>

                <p>Identifying stakeholders in any project is vital in order to gain insights as to who uses the product, and how can the product can be design to suit their needs. In a brainstorming activity, our team revealed a recurring trait in some of the key stakeholders - there are a variety of users that may have a limited gauge on the English language - these include tourists, immigrants & international students.</p>
                <p>With the assistance of our tutor, Sophie, we decided on our problem space: <b>Due to the language barrier, non-native speakers may find it difficult to navigate around Sydney. </b></p>

                <br>For our first research assignment, our overall objective is to gain an understanding on how this target market navigates around Sydney. We posed the following research questions:<br>
1. What problems do non-native speakers encounter while travelling around?  <br>
2. What are they currently doing to fix that problem?  <br>
3. What does a typical trip look like for a non-native speaker?  <br>
4. What modes of transport do they currently use?  <br>
5. How do non-native speaking users navigate?  What apps and devices do commuters use to assist their commuting experience? Other people? or Physical environment/Signage? <br>
Our aim is to apply appropriate methods to answer the above questions.</p>

                <p>The group divided the target research market of non-native speakers into three subgroups: tourists, international students and migrants. I was assigned to conduct my research on migrants. We browsed a variety of User Research methods using Tomitsch et al.’s 2017 book, Design. Think. Make. Break Repeat. 
                After careful consideration, we decided on the following methods:  Interviews , questionnaires and contextual observation .</p>
                <p> A combination of these methods will give us a robust and rich understanding of the user experience.</p>

                <p>As I was assigned to conduct my first hand research on migrants, a key issue was made apparent: the language barrier between I, the interviewer, and of course the interviewee. In order to overcome this, I went to suburbs in which migrant population are the most dense - Fairfield and Liverpool. I utilised my extremely limited Arabic and Indonesian skills to good use.<br>
The first method I employed was Questionnaires. This method is an easy way to obtain insights into the user's self reported behaviour, attitudes or experiences. The second method I employed was Interviews. This method revealed information about a problem area and gets users opinions on concepts. They are useful in gathering concrete information about existing experiences. Finally, the last method I employed was Contextual Observation. The method reeals user behaviour and emotions, which is especially useful for this task due to the language barrier.</p>The following slides portrays what questions were asked for the methods:</p>

To extrapolate further from the data set, a user persona was ideated to allow us to engage with the needs of the user, as well as including their voice in all phases of the design process. The interview data was plotted on a spectrum to assist in visualising what a typical user could look like.

                <p>Our findings from our individual reports were pooled together to be analysed as a whole. Some interesting points that arose were:<br>
                <ul>
  <li>Driving in Sydney is stressful, and so Public Transport is a better alternative </li>
  <li>Due to unfamiliarity, users aren't sure when to get on and off</li>
  <li>Users are heavily reliant on phone to navigate (as opposed to kiosks and signage)</li>
  <li>Users are wary of using autonomous vehicles, only if it's a guaranteed fact that it is safe  - Users don't rely on one app - they use a combination of TripView, NextThere or GoogleMaps, depending on what service they're using </li>
  <li>Migrants would still rather use English service in order to learn the language </li>
  <li>Need for visual and audible stimulation.</li>
</ul></p>
<br><p>
From this, we created an objective:<i> <b>Develop an interaction with autonomous vehicles that eases stress and eliminates confusion for non-native speaking tourists navigating around Sydney.</b></i>This is a statement we will refer back to throughout the design process, to ensure that we will meet the user’s need and wants to create the best possible solution.</p>

                <p>We continued to develop our concepts, implementing methods such as Brain-writing 635 and Leapfrogging. The Brain writing 635 method is a brainstorming technique allowed us to think outside the box and develop a medley of concepts. Leapfrogging was an interesting method of pulling out two completely different ideas and creating a concept out of the two mediums together.<br>

After this, we concluded on three ideas, and assigned each person to develop the concept further.<br>
<ul><li> Autonomous Tour Bus App (Salma)</li>
<li> Autonomous Tour Bus Kiosk (Ellie)</li>
<li> Autonomous Tour Vehicle (Ben)</li></ul></p>

                <p>This week was spent creating sketches of our app. A large number of rough sketches were made, and tested on users so that they can gain a feel of the app. These apps were put through POP. We tested on other students in the Wilkinson building, employing the think-aloud protocol to gain insights to their attitude towards certain features of the app. We gave the user a scenario and asked them to use the app accordingly, and they succeeded in doing so. It was made clear that our concept was running smoothly.

Things we picked up upon were where their fingers hovered towards, or where did their eyes look at first. It was clear that the participants looked for headings and visual cues. It was also made apparent that the navigation bar had <i>too</i> many icons, and that the boxes are too small for them to click. We then thought into account the potential of streamlining the navigation bar, as this will also avoid confusion yet declutter the aesthetic.</p></div></div>

Research of aesthetic quality was conducted through Dribbble, Behance & Sketch Resources. Our team concluded that we wanted to evoke Australia through the colours of yellow and green.<br>

                <p>Several iterations of our interface was created as discrepencies arose within our group member's personal style. Little details such as typeface and positioning of elements were factors of dispute, however, the group came together and made decisions as a consensus. Some obstacles we encountered was colour palette, as the yellow and the vibrancy of green that we chose clashed with the white. In future, I will consider thinking out the aesthetic and colour palette much earlier on in the design process. By far the most tedious, and time consuming task that we had to do was linking and adding all the transitions from screen to screen on invision especially due to the having so many screens (257) - however, Ellie pulled an all nighter and managed to come through. Some feedback from both Hollie and Sophie were "That's sick" and "Awesome work!".<br>

<p>Then, I created our compation website which can be accessed <u><a href="https://salmaira1.github.io/DECO2200/companion-website.html">here</a></u>. The website was somewhat tedious to complete, as my coding skills are subpar - however, with the help of Hamish, Will and Sophie, minor bugs were fixed. The video walkthrough was the final task, which involved writing the script, recording and editing the video all together.  </p>
